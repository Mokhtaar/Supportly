# SupportGenius - Multi-Tenant AI Support Platform

A modern SaaS platform for creating AI-powered customer support agents with multi-tenant architecture.

## Features

- **Multi-Tenant Architecture**: Each company gets their own isolated workspace
- **AI Support Agents**: Create intelligent agents trained on your knowledge base
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Owner, Admin, and Member roles with different permissions
- **Knowledge Base Management**: Upload and process documents for agent training
- **Multiple Communication Channels**: Web chat, WhatsApp, Telegram, and API
- **Subscription Plans**: FREE, STARTER, PROFESSIONAL, and ENTERPRISE tiers

## Getting Started

### 1. Initial Setup

```bash
npm install
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npm run dev
```

### 2. User Registration and Company Creation

The application now uses a multi-tenant model where each company (Client) can have multiple users and agents.

**New User Flow:**
1. User signs up at `/auth/signup`
2. User confirms their email
3. User signs in and is redirected to `/onboarding`
4. User creates their company and selects a plan
5. User is redirected to the dashboard

**Company Structure:**
- **Client**: Represents a company/organization
- **Users**: Belong to a client with roles (OWNER, ADMIN, MEMBER)
- **Agents**: Belong to a client, created by users
- **Knowledge Base**: Isolated per client

### 3. Role Permissions

- **OWNER**: Full access, can manage users and billing
- **ADMIN**: Can manage agents and invite users
- **MEMBER**: Can use agents and view analytics

### 4. API Endpoints

All API endpoints are now client-scoped and require proper authentication:

- `GET/POST /api/agent` - List/create agents for your company
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/agent/[id]` - Manage specific agent
- `POST /api/onboarding` - Create new company during signup
- `POST /api/knowledge-base/upload` - Upload documents
- `POST /api/chat` - Chat with agents

### 5. Database Schema

The multi-tenant schema includes:
- `clients` - Company information with subscription plans
- `users` - User accounts linked to clients
- `agents` - AI agents owned by clients
- `knowledge_base` - Documents scoped to agents/clients
- `chat_history` - Conversation logs
- `api_keys` - API access tokens

## Development

### Testing the Onboarding Flow

1. Clear your database (if testing): `npx prisma db push --force-reset`
2. Start the application: `npm run dev`
3. Sign up for a new account
4. Complete the onboarding process
5. Create your first AI agent

## Architecture
